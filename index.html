<!--NOTE:  October 19th, 2018:  This is the week2 Friday personal project for Epicodus.  The goal of this is to create a website that asks the user a set of questions (at least 5), and will suggest a coding track of Epicodus (1 of 3 (min)).  ALL of Week 1's coding requirements are still required.  You are required to use all week 2's lesson objectives: Javascript and JQuery, and contional branching.

The 5 tracks at Epicodus are:
-Ruby/Rails
-Ruby/React
-Java/Andriod
-CSS/Design
-C#/.NET

There is also an intro to programming course offered in the evenings.
